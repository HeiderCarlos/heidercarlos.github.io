<div style="text-align: justifyt">
I am a English <-> Portuguese (Brazil) translator. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Translation from the Federal University of Uberl√¢ndia (UFU) and am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Linguistics at the same university.

I have extensive technical knowledge, with a degree in Civil Engineering and a technical qualification in Electromechanics. Additionally, I have a broad cultural background, particularly in geek/nerd culture, and have been writing for over 15 years for websites specializing in comics, movies, games, TV series, anime, and manga.

I have been translating since my teenage years but have been working professionally as a translator since 2019. During this time, I have translated documents, academic articles, financial reports, subtitled videos, and MTPE. I have worked and continue to work for international companies such as Flitto, JuneFirst, Appen, OneForma, PGLS, and Transphere, among others. You can check the professional recommendations I received on my <a href='https://www.proz.com/profile/2679500'>Proz Profile</a> or get in touch using the methods below.
