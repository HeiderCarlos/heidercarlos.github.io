I have been translating since my teenage years, and I work as a translator since 2019.

Currently, I am doing a Master's Degree in Linguistics at the Federal University of Uberlândia (UFU). I have a bachelor degree in Translation at the Federal University of Uberlândia (UFU), a bachelor degree in Civil Engineering at the University President Antônio Carlos (UNIPAC) and I was an exchange student for one year at the Newcastle University, UK. I write for blogs, newsletters and popculture site. For an indepth look of my production, please check this website's tabs.
