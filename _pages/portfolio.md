Since most of my work is under NDA, I cannot discuss it in detail here. However, you can see the clients I've worked with on my CV and read their feedback on my <a href='https://www.proz.com/profile/2679500'>Proz Profile</a>. Below, I’ll list the sites I write for, my newsletters, and the projects I’ve subtitled. Notice, however, that unfortunately many of the sites I contributed to extensively in the past, such as MeioOrc and AnimeHaus, are now offline.<br><br><br>
